Blottr, For Sustained Safety
 
Prevention is Better than Cure.
And for us to better sustain human safety, we will crowdsource incident reports against safety. This will help our government to put action, against offenders, and educate the youth to make our community a safer place.
 
Blotter, is the safety reporting app for the world. We aim to ease informing the authorities for cases of incidences for public safety.
 
There is already law against harassment and started in Quezon City. This empower women to disclose harassment cases. But women, would probably be "embarrassed" to visit a barangay hall just to report the issue. There could be an uncomfortable experience even at the Police Children and Women's help desk. 
 
We want to remove the hassle for this process, and add a nice campaign slogan acceptable to many.
 
How to Blottr?
 
Best way to use Blottr is to use the mobile app and submit your reports. There are 3 ways to Blottr.
 
Disclose - is the formal incident reporting utility. It patterns from the Police Helpdesk Blotter logbook and aims to automate the logging of "blotter reports" but with a twist of crowdsourcing
 
Alert – is to generate an emergency distress call and trigger device functions intended for safety (i.e. GPS, SMS Notify number, Last geolocation stamp, timestamp). Can be called a panic button, or a tracking beacon

Prevent – is a Known Issue and Problem Case repository. People can view here guides, existing cases (court cases), or group of incidents worked on by the government.

Other features can be found in the web-platform to be utilized by the LGU’s or Location Group holders, or even agencies like DSWD or NBI. Other processes involved: ITIL: Incident and Problem Management.
